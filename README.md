## Software Required  

All the main software used in the Device Modelling Group can be found in [Computational Tools and Links](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/eng/research/grouplist/sensorsanddevices/nanolab/internal/tools/) (only accessible to internal group members).  

If you are an external group member, please download these three desktop applications listed below as they are essential for carrying out calculations for **PX915 Part II peer-to-peer UQ exercise**:  

- [Jmol](http://jmol.sourceforge.net/)  
  - please also download the [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) package to run Jmol  
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)  
  - please set Notepad++ as your default text editor  
- [Winscp](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php)  
  - use Winscp to submit calculations on SCRTP hardware  

Please also make sure to have an active SCRTP Linux Desktop account.
